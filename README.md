> Get REA from [morluto/rea](https://github.com/morluto/rea),
> [rea.tools](https://rea.tools/), or the [rea-agents npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rea-agents).
> Follow the installation and release links from these official sources. A similar

available. Run package acquisition from a trusted directory outside the target
project. Installation and recovery details are in the setup guide below.

Setup supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Grok Build and
[other agents](docs/installation.md#supported-agents). See
[installation and setup](docs/installation.md) for provider configuration and
manual MCP registration and Claude Code/Codex plugin installation.

MCP uses compact input schemas by default to reduce context overhead. Set
`REA_MCP_INPUT_SCHEMA_PROFILE=full` in your MCP registration when you need the
complete advertised field guidance and nested validation details. Both profiles
keep the full tool set and canonical server validation. See
"Compact input schema profile" in the MCP contracts guide.

Complete output schemas are advertised by default. If your client caps the
complete `tools/list` frame, set `REA_MCP_OUTPUT_SCHEMA_PROFILE=compact` to
bound each advertised output schema, or `off` to omit output schemas entirely.
Both settings keep canonical server-side validation and complete structured
results. See "Output schemas" in the MCP contracts guide.

### Ask your agent

```text
Understand how search works in the Notes app, show me the evidence, and build a
similar feature for my project.
```

Replace Notes with your target app and the feature you want to understand.

### Use the terminal

Inspect an extracted JavaScript/Electron app directory or ASAR:

```bash
npx -y rea-agents@latest analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

The result includes modules, imports, Electron boundaries and their evidence.
Replace the path with your target, such as `"D:/apps/example"` on Windows.

To install the `rea` command for regular use:

```bash
npm install --global rea-agents
rea --help
```

For native analysis, configure a provider first. See the
[CLI and Evidence guide](docs/cli.md) for native commands, provider selection,
snapshots and scripting.

### Update REA

REA changes quickly, and new releases include frequent bug fixes. Keep your
installation up to date.

For a CLI installed with `npm install --global` or `bun add --global`:

```bash
rea update
```

`rea --update` is an alias for this verified workflow and accepts the same global
output flags. Use `rea update` when combining it with other command controls.

Updater commands retain at most 4 MiB of stdout and stderr combined. Oversized
metadata replies are rejected after the command exits; verbose installs continue
with bounded diagnostics. Human progress output respects terminal backpressure
and waits for submitted writes to finish.

Bun global updates require Bun 1.2.17 or later. With an older Bun release,
upgrade Bun manually before running `rea update`.

To refresh your agent registrations and skill, run the setup command printed
by the update.

If you use `npx`, update your agent setup with:

```bash
npx rea-agents@latest setup
```

Review the setup changes and restart your agent. For one-off CLI commands,
use `npx rea-agents@latest` followed by the command. With Bun, use
`bunx rea-agents@latest` in place of `npx rea-agents@latest`.

## How REA works

Your agent calls REA through MCP to inspect the target and trace relevant code.
REA returns findings with their evidence. The agent uses them to ask follow-up
questions, explain the behavior, or write and test an implementation.
CLI commands use the same workflows.

![REA investigation flow: your agent asks about a local target, REA inspects and traces it using analysis tools, and the agent uses the returned code, references and unknowns to explain, implement and test.](website/public/assets/figures/rea-investigation-flow.svg)

## What you can analyze

REA requires Node.js 22.x (>=22.23.4), 24.x (>=24.22.1), or 26.12.1+, plus npm.
Additional tools and host support depend on the target:
